        static string intro4 = "I swear, he has some of the dumbest ideas sometimes.";

        static string question1 = "What is your favorite color?";
        static string question1p2 = "And please, stick to primary and secondary colors. No \"aquamarine\" or \"burgundy\" some other weird shit. It's hard enough as it is having a response for the random stuff people will put in here.";

        static string greenResponse = "Oh, the color green! Such a nice color, reminds me of weed. Did you know, that the first time the word was used was to describe the color of grass? The word was actually spelled \"grene\" back then.";

        static string whiteResponse = "Bruh. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to roast you. Who chooses \"white\" as their favorite color? Either you're just a really dull person, or you're a racist. There's no in between.";

        static string unknownGenre = "Huh. I haven't heard of that genre before. Then again, I only know what genres Jalen knows. So either he doesn't know that much about music, or you mispelled your genre. Dumbass.";

        static string drawingResponse = "Woah, we have an artist here! Jalen used to draw before (he's not very good)";
        static string gameResponse = "I detected game, so I'm going to assume you meant video games, because nobody plays board games unless it's family game night or Cards Against Humanity.";
